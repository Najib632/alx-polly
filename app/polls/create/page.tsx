  /**
   * `CreatePollPage` serves as the dedicated page for users to create new polls.
   *
   * @description
   * This component acts as a container or a "route" component within the application's
   * routing structure (e.g., Next.js App Router). Its primary responsibility is to
   * render the `CreatePollForm` component within a consistent page layout. By
   * abstracting the page structure away from the form logic, we maintain a clean
   * separation of concerns.
   *
   * @why
   * In a page-based routing system, each URL typically maps to a page component.
   * This page provides the `/polls/create` (or similar) route. It ensures that the
   * poll creation functionality has a dedicated, linkable URL and is presented
   * within the standard application layout (e.g., with a navbar, footer, etc.,
   * which are likely part of a parent layout).
   *
   * @assumptions
   * - The application uses a file-based routing system where this file's location
   *   (e.g., `app/polls/create/page.tsx`) determines its URL.
   * - The `CreatePollForm` component is self-contained and handles all the logic
   *   for form state, validation, and submission.
   * - Global CSS, like TailwindCSS, is configured to provide utility classes such as
   *   `container`, `mx-auto`, etc., for consistent styling.
   *
   * @edgeCases
   * - **Authentication:** This page might be protected. If an unauthenticated user
   *   tries to access it, they should be redirected. This logic is typically handled
   *   by middleware or a higher-order component/layout, not directly within this page.
   * - **Component Not Found:** If `CreatePollForm` fails to import or render, this
   *   page would likely crash or show an error boundary, depending on the framework's
   *   error handling.
   *
   * @connections
   * - **Parent:** Rendered by the root layout (`app/layout.tsx` in Next.js) and the
   *   routing system.
   * - **Child:** Renders the `<CreatePollForm />` component, which contains the
   *   actual form fields and submission logic.
   * - **Navigation:** After successful poll creation within `CreatePollForm`, the
   *   application will likely navigate the user away from this page to either the
   *   new poll's detail page or a list of their polls.
